- **type_0_discount, type_1_discount, …** – Various promotional discount rates applied.

### 🏷️ Key Columns in `inventory.csv`
- **unique_id** – Inventory ID.
- **product_unique_id** – Product ID across warehouses.
- **name** – Product name.
- **L1_category_name, L2_category_name, …** – Hierarchical product categorization.
- **warehouse** – Warehouse location.

### 📅 Key Columns in `calendar.csv`
- **warehouse** – Warehouse location.
